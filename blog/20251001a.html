            <h1>Random stuffs 2nd</h1>
                <p>Xin chào / Hello / Здравствуйте!</p>
                <p>Welcome to the first <i>Random stuffs</i> post! This is the <i>Random stuffs</i> post of September 2025.</p>
                <p>But apparently, it has been October already. I'm sorry for being late, but I had many things to do so yeah.</p>
                <p>Anyway, shall we begin?</p>
                <h2>The first month of the school year</h2>
                    <p>It has been a month since we started going to school again. For me, it could've been better, if I wasn't a <a href="20250905a.html">monitor</a>.</p>
                    <p>By the way I'm telling you guys that I attend to [VHLGsOG7nW5nIFRIQ1MgQW4gTmjGoW4gLSBRdeG6rW4gR8OyIFbhuqVw].</p>
                    <p>Alright let's just move on.</p>
                <h2>Death of Charlie Kirk</h2>
                    <p>Some weeks ago, a conservative whose name was Charlie Kirk was assassinated.</p>
                    <p>Well, who killed him? According to information which I know, it was likely Tyler James Robinson. So, why did he do such a thing? Of course, because political motives.</p>
                    <p>So, what is my opinion on this? Obviously, it is a horrible idea to assassinate someone, except when the target is an evil extremist — it will be reasonable. But as you can see, Charlie wasn't a bad person and he hadn't killed anyone, at least that's what I know, and killing a person is evil anyway.</p>
                    <p>In any case, R.I.P. Charles James Kirk (14th of October, 1993 – 10th of September, 2025)</p>
                    <p>It's sad to see a person died 5 days before my birthday. Well, let's talk about something better, OK?</p>
                <h2>Minecraft LIVE</h2>
                    <p>On 27th of September, Mojang dropped the &laquo;<a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_LIVE_%E2%80%93_September_2025">Minecraft LIVE – September 2025</a>&raquo;, and I'm not telling them to pick it up! I felt bad that I couldn't watch it... I mean, it started at 17:00 UTC(+/-0), which was MIDNIGHT in UTC+7!!!!!!11!!!!!1!1</p>
                    <p>For more information about it, go and watch it. I'm just saying what I'm interested in.</p>
                    <p>The best thing about this Minecraft LIVE is <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Spear">spear</a>! I was about creating spears in my mod but oh well...</p>
                    <p>And as a quotation: &laquo;<i><a href="https://stick-war.fandom.com/wiki/Spearton">Born to die, but not before them!</a></i>&raquo;</p>
                    <p>Well, that's all for this month...</p>
