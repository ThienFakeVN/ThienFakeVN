        <h1>Random stuffs 3rd</h1>
            <p>Xin chào / Hello / Здравствуйте!</p>
            <p>Welcome to the third <i>Random stuffs</i> post! This is the <i>Random stuffs</i> post of October 2025.</p>
            <p>This time I'm not being late! Haha!</p>
            <p>Ok...ok... Let's begin.</p>
            <h2>Halloween</h2>
                <p>So, apparently today is Halloween. Well, I... don't have any idea what todo, so I will just... don't do anything, hehe.</p>
            <h2>No Nut November</h2>
                <p>In November, there's one legendary mission — do not goon.</p>
                <p>Well, I started doing NNN since last year. I failed that year at 16 or 17th (I don't remember the exact day). Well, I am going to do well this time, bet?</p>
            <h2>Great month for DOORS</h2>
                <p>I start playing DOORS again a month ago or something. And in this month, I was doing well! Completing the Rooms again and the most of all, finally completing the Mines!</p>
                <p>Anyway, this is the list of milestones in my DOORS journey:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>~17 or 18th May 2024: Started playing DOORS;</li>
                        <li>22th June 2024: Completed the Hotel;</li>
                        <li>16th July 2024: Completed the Rooms;</li>
                        <li>~June, July or August 2024: Completed the Backdoors;</li>
                        <li>25 August 2025: Completed the Outdoors;</li>
                        <li>26 october 2025: Completed the Mines (newest as of now).</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Well, that's all... OR IS IT? <!--Yeah, pretty short, since this month seems doesn't have anything interesting, and I have no idea what to right, ugh!--></p>
            <h2>(New) Year of injuries</h2>
                <p>So I have a question: Have you ever had a cut on your leg, then fallen and got your knee wounded, and then fallen one more time and had to use a crutch to walk? If you say yes, then you had got the same situation with me in the literal start of this year (2025). So, what truly happened?</p>
                <p>So, on the 5th of January, when I was walking, I suddenly touched my father's motorbike's footrest. I felt a pain, but I didn't think it was bad. And guess what — I was wrong. When I was watching the 2024 ASEAN Championship final, I looked down at my leg and oh shit I saw a scratch on my leg! After that, I just... rubbed oil on it and went to bed, not to sleep though. In the moment, I thought, &laquo;Ah no, it's just the beginning&raquo;. And, however, this time I was CORRECT.</p>
                <p>At the midnight between 24th and 25th of January, if you know, this was Tết of 2025. So, at the midnight of said days, before when the fireworks were being fired, normally, you would not like to go completely outside, it's dangerous, but in the moment, I decided to go out my safe spot and run back when the fireworks were fired. But when I was running — bam! — I felt an injured my knee. So I wasn't able to see the rest fireworks and I decided to not go anywhere — just sleep on my hammock.</p>
                <p>But that wasn't the worst, when I went back to school, the students attended to a school's activity session, I sat right next to the student on whom I have a crush (let's go) but right in that moment, I look at my finger, and for some reason it was BLEEDING, WTF? But even that wasn't the worst. When the session ended, we had a plenty of free time, I was like yessir and running happily, and — BAM! — I felt and this time the area near my ankle was hurt a lot! I couldn't even walk normally. I painfully walked to and sat on a bench. Some of my friends saw me and each of them all recommended me to go to the medical room but I, partly thought my school's medical room seemed... suspicious, partly thought it would be normal so I decided to not go, even though my head was already generating images of me being confined on a wheelchair. The good new was, it didn't happen. The bad new was, a bone near my ankle was cracked, so I had to use a crutch to walk for nearly 2 month.</p>
                <p>Well, that's the last disaster, which also ends this post</p>
