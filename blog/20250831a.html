        <h1>Random stuffs 1st</h1>
            <p>Xin chào / Hello / Здравствуйте!</p>
            <p>Welcome to the first <i>Random stuffs</i> post! This is a new type of post which I will make at the end of a month (might be delayed to next month though). In a <i>Random stuffs</i> post, I will talk about all interesting and recent topics, instead of having each topic in a single post like usual. Well, those are the only differences between a <i>Random stuffs</i> post and a regular post as of now.</p>
            <p>This is the <i>Random stuffs</i> post of August 2025.</p>
            <p>Well, in any case, shall we start?</p>
            <h2>Military parade and events on 2nd of September</h2>
                <p>If you don't know, 02.09 (DD.MM) is the Vietnamese National Day. To celebrate this day, the Vietnamese government has decided to hold a parade in Hanoi. Troops have been pratising a lot. We also invited several countries to this parade, Russia for instance. It's going to be a great day for sure! (So bad I couldn't see it)</p>
                <p>But that's not all! Recently, the Vietnamese government has also announced that each Vietnamese can receive a hundred thousand Vietnamese dong! Even though it's just 3 dollars and 79 cents, but every banknote counts, and it still matters to me :D but not everyone thinks so.</p>
                <p>Some people say that 100k isn't a lot, and the government should use it for social security instead. This view is just kind of like when you work for a restaurant and you refuse to receive tips from a customer because that is just a few kopecks and you are concerned for the customer's financial conditions. I mean, it is good to be thoughtful, but that just went pretty far... and if you reject the money because it isn't a lot then give me that money bruh.</p>
                <p>Point is, the government has provided money for social security and similar issues, and as I've said — every banknote counts, and 100k is really a lot for many people.</p>
                <p>Also, if you need, you can convert 100000 VND into your currency right <a href="https://wise.com/gb/currency-converter/vnd-to-usd-rate?amount=100000">here</a>.</p>
                <h3>A terrible accident happened</h3>
                    <p>Before hoding a parade, what do we need to do? Of course, pratise! As I've said, Vietnamese troops (and troops of countries which we invited) have been pratising recently. However, in these days, several incidents occured. Well, even though most of them weren't as severe as the meaning of the word &laquo;incident&raquo; (or they are severer, I don't know), but they were still bad, yeah. Luckily though, there was no incident which was too serious, right?</p>
                    <p>Well, this one which I'm telling, it wasn't just a little issue, but rather a terrible traffic accident. So there were 2 guys who were riding on a motorbike being chased by the police and they entered the road where the troops match. And no, no soldier was there at the time, but there were some policemen, and one of them was Lê Đình Công. The 2 on the motobike crashed into Lê Đình Công and all of them were hospitalised in critical condition. Luckily they are all okay now.</p>
                    <p>And if you want to see a video of the accident, it's <a href="../media/blog/5247782520525494835.mp4">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>That was very bad and sad, wasn't it? Well, let's move on with something better.</p>
            <h2>A new academic year</h2>
                <p>If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, a new academic year is going to start, or has even started already for many people (whilst in the Southern Hemisphere, students still have to go to school on weekdays... hope you guys can survive until November or December).</p>
                <p>How about me? I will start going to school on 8th of September. That means I have a week and a day to prepare.</p>
                <p>I'm a Vietnamese, and I go to a Vietnamese school, and as I see, Vietnamese schools are different to schools in other countries. So, would you guys like to see what are in Vietnamese schools? Well, even if you don't, I will still tell. Keep in mind that I do not attend all Vietnamese schools, so I will only say what are in my school and what other Vietnamese say about their schools. Also, this is just about regular public schools, as I've got no idea what private schools are like, and international schools in Vietnam are very similar to Western schools.</p>
                <p>Firstly, a Vietnamese class will have a student being the monitor (lớp trưởng). They are the representative of the student of the class in school. There are also &laquo;vice-monitors&raquo; (lớp phó) who take other responsibilities in the class. Most vice-monitors are in charge of class' learning/discipline/chores, let's call them &laquo;learning/discipline/chores vice-monitor&raquo; (lớp phó học tập/kỷ luật/lao động) respectively. A class are also divided into (usually 4) groups, and one of a group's member will be the leader (it is possible to have a vice-leader, but it's rare and unofficial). The monitor, vice-monitors and group leaders are of &laquo;ban cán sự lớp&raquo;, let's just call them &laquo;monitor group&raquo;. And guess what, I am a vice-monitor (learing vice-monitor to be clear)! But well, in fact, no one wants to have any role of the monitor group, as it is very very hard to manage (an affair or a group of) a class as a student.</p>
                <p>Let's move on with something else, like academic achievements. There is this thing which is called &laquo;Học lực&raquo;. &laquo;Học lực&raquo; of a student is based on grades in their tests (tests are also interesting). There are 6 levels of &laquo;Học lực&raquo; (from worst to best): Kém (Very Bad), Yếu (Bad), Trung bình (Average), Khá (Fair), Giỏi (Good) and Xuất sắc (Excellent). Students with Giỏi and Xuất sắc will be awarded with achievements, an academic year in Vietnam is divided into 2 terms only by the way. There is also something called &laquo;Hạnh kiểm&raquo; which is based on your behaviours. If your &laquo;Hạnh kiểm&raquo; level is not &laquo;Tốt&raquo; then you're not able to receive any award of &laquo;Học lực&raquo;.</p>
                <p>Oh and I've just said that Vietnamese tests are interesting. In most subjects, there are 4 regular/mini/15-mins tests (kiểm tra thường xuyên/15 phút), 1 mid-term/45-mins test/exam (kiểm tra giữa kỳ/45 phút) and 1 end-of-term exam (kiểm tra cuối kỳ). Regular tests are similar to American quizzes. Some subjects may have very simple and unexpected regular tests: pull out a paper, the teacher will write questions and problems on the board and the students have to solve them in 15 minutes; but in some subjects, students will be informed and about the test and have plenty of time to study for it, and they will also have more time in the test. Regular test is translated into &laquo;Mini test&raquo; by English teachers, but I disagree with that translation.</p>
                <p>The mid-term tests are kind of special. In my school, mid-term tests of Maths, English, History&Geography and one more subject which I forgot, perhaps... Hoạt động Trải nghiệm, what the heck is that subject?? But anyway, that 4 subjects' mid-term tests are always taken on Mondays of the 4 mid-term weeks and they seem to be very formal, to the point that I should call them &laquo;exams&raquo;; other subjects' mid-term tests aren't very formal compared to the last 4, some of them are even as simple as 15-mins tests, except that students have 45 minutes.</p>
                <p>Finally is the final exams — end-of-term exams. They are just complicated. In the first week, we will take exams of basic and unimportant subjects in the mornings. But in the second week, well, exams can be taken both in mornings and afternoons. Also, if a class takes an exam in the morning, they may or may not need to be at school in the afternoon and vice versa.</p>
                <p>Well... that's all I can tell in this post, I will post a full one on 5th of September or later, or sooner, I don't know.</p>
                <p>And that's the end of the first <i>Random stuffs</i> post. I will post another one at the end of September 2025. About the DOORS full content post, I aim to post it in September or October, no promise though, and I apologise for posting it so late! Well, perhaps we could wait until the third floor releases?</p>
                <p>That's all! Thanks for reading!</p>
